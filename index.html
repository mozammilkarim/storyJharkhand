            <h3>An intro to Jharkhand</h3>
            <p>Jharkhand (lit. "Bushland" or "The land of forest") is a state in eastern India.[6] The state shares its border with the states of Bihar to the north, Uttar Pradesh to the northwest, Chhattisgarh to the west, Odisha to the south and West Bengal to the east. It has an area of 79,710 km2 (30,778 sq mi). It is the 15th largest state by area, and the 14th largest by population. Hindi is the official language of the state.[3] The city of Ranchi is its capital and Dumka its sub capital. The state is known for its waterfalls, hills and holy places;[7] Baidyanath Dham, Parasnath and Rajrappa are major religious sites.[8]

                Jharkhand suffers from what is sometimes termed a resource curse:[9] it accounts for more than 40% of the mineral resources of India,[10] but 39.1% of its population is below the poverty line and 19.6% of children under five years of age are malnourished.[11] The state is primarily rural, with only 24% of the population living in cities.[12] Jharkhand is among the leading states in economic growth. In 2017–18, the GSDP growth rate of state was at 10.22%</p>

            <p id="storyPara" >15 November 1875 – 9 June 1900) was an Indian tribal freedom fighter, religious leader, and folk hero who belonged to the Munda tribe. He spearheaded a tribal religious Millenarian movement that arose in the Bengal Presidency (now Jharkhand) in the late 19th century, during the British Raj, thereby making him an important figure in the history of the Indian independence movement.[4] The revolt mainly concentrated in the Munda belt of Khunti, Tamar, Sarwada and Bandgaon.[5]

                His portrait hangs in the Indian Parliament Museum;[6] he is the only tribal leader to have been so honored
